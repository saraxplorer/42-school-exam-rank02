Development journey: the one that worked

Step 1. Join the two strings:

	1. Join them without allocating memory.
 	2. use two separate while loops to iterate.
  	3. try to print/write the joined string meanwhile. Important: we would need a new iterator for 	the new joined string because i has the number of the concatenated string, not 0. to iterate through the whole string, we would need a new iterator that starts from 0.
