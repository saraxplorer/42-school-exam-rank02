Development steps:
STEP 1. Find whether it is a palindrome:

      1.1. make a function that gets a start and end point, compares those points and subsequent points in a loop, the one by one, 
      It increases and reduces like this, start++ and end--: meaning those points are used as indexes

        1.1.1. The loop will continue as long as the start and end point are different
        1.1.2.  to get the start and end point, we simply send one char as index (example i), from a loop, then send another series
                char from another loop(example j).
   
STEP 2. If it is palindrome, find the longest one by compare and update:
STEP 3. Then print the longest one:
