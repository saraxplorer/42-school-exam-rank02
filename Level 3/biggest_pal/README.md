Development steps:
STEP 1. Find whether it is a palindrome:

      1.1. make a function that gets a start and end point, compares those points in a loop, one by one, 
      increases and reduces like this, start++ and end--

        1.1.1. to get the start and end point, we need to compare each char of the string, with the rest. If the chars matched, we send them as start and end point
   
STEP 2. If it is palindrome, find the longest one by compare and update:
STEP 3. Then print the longest one:
