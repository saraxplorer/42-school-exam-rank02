ssize_t write(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count);
2 ways to use write.
#1. because it is expecting a pointer, a pointer needs to be made.
    then the address to the pointer to the specific char needs to be passed. 

#include <unistd.h>
int main()
{
	char *str = "good"; //made a pointer
	int i = 0; //int to track char
	while (str[i]!='\0')
	{
		write(1, &str[i], 1);
		i++;
	}
}
Here,
a: Pointer variable storing the memory address of the start of the string.
&a: Memory address where the pointer a is stored.
&a[i]: Memory address of the i-th character in the string a.
so write(1, a, 1); will write ggggg
  write(1, &a, 1);will print nothing
  write(1, &str[i], 1);prints letter by letter
